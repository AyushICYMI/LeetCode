# Minimum Cost Path with Alternating Directions II

## Problem Statement
You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively. The cost to enter cell `(i, j)` is defined as `(i + 1) * (j + 1)`. You are also given a 2D integer array `waitCost` where `waitCost[i][j]` defines the cost to wait on that cell.

You start at cell `(0, 0)` at second 1. At each step, you follow an alternating pattern:
- On odd-numbered seconds, you must move right or down to an adjacent cell, paying its entry cost.
- On even-numbered seconds, you must wait in place, paying `waitCost[i][j]`.

Return the minimum total cost required to reach `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

## Intuition
The problem requires navigating a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner with alternating move and wait steps. The key is to minimize the total cost, which includes both the entry costs of the cells you move into and the wait costs of the cells you stay in during even seconds. 

## Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**:
   - Use a DP table `dp[i][j]` to store the minimum cost to reach cell `(i, j)`.
   - The entry cost for cell `(i, j)` is `(i + 1) * (j + 1)`.
   - The wait cost for cell `(i, j)` is given by `waitCost[i][j]`.

2. **Transitions**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the cost can come from either the top `(i-1, j)` or the left `(i, j-1)`.
   - When moving from a previous cell, the total cost includes:
     - The cost to reach the previous cell.
     - The entry cost of the current cell (paid during the move, which happens on an odd second).
     - The wait cost of the previous cell (paid during the even second before moving, if applicable).

3. **Initialization**:
   - The starting cell `(0, 0)` has an initial cost of 1 (since entry cost is `(0+1)*(0+1) = 1` and there's no prior wait).
   - The first row and first column are initialized considering only right or down movements, respectively, with intermediate waits.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) since we iterate through each cell of the grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP table. This can be optimized to O(n) by using a 1D DP array if only the previous row is needed.

## Solution Code
```cpp
using ll = long long;
class Solution {
public:
    long long minCost(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& wait) {
        if (m == 0 || n == 0)
            return 0;

        vector<vector<ll>> dp(m, vector<ll>(n, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            ll prev = dp[0][j - 1];
            ll entry = (ll)(j + 1);
            ll cost = entry + ((j - 1 > 0) ? wait[0][j - 1] : 0);
            dp[0][j] = prev + cost;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            ll prev = dp[i - 1][0];
            ll entry = (ll)(i + 1);
            ll cost = entry + ((i - 1 > 0) ? wait[i - 1][0] : 0);
            dp[i][0] = prev + cost;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                ll entry = (ll)(i + 1) * (j + 1);
                ll fromTop = dp[i - 1][j] + wait[i - 1][j] + entry;
                ll fromLeft = dp[i][j - 1] + wait[i][j - 1] + entry;
                dp[i][j] = min(fromTop, fromLeft);
            }
        }

        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
